# Deep Learning Model for Fashion Classification

Project Overview: Developed a deep learning model using TensorFlow for an app that predicts and recommends suitable clothing based on user preferences.

Model Functionality: The model performs multi-output classification of fashion attributes, including article type, base color, gender, and usage, leveraging transfer learning for efficient feature extraction.

Recommendation System: Integrated the classification model into a personalized recommendation engine, which analyzes user preferences to suggest tailored clothing options.

Optimization: Employed Keras Tuner with RandomSearch for hyperparameter tuning, focusing on optimizing learning rate and enhancing the accuracy of predictions across all outputs.

Results: Achieved high accuracy in predicting multiple fashion categories and delivered relevant, user-specific clothing recommendations, improving the overall app experience.
